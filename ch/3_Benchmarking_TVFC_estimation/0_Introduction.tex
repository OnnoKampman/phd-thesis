\info[inline]{Paragraph: Introduce benchmarking chapter.}
In this chapter we describe the benchmarks studied and compare the \gls{tvfc} estimation methods described in \cref{ch:methods}.
We start with simulations-based benchmarks and then move on to benchmarks based on real data, both \gls{rs-fmri} and \gls{tb-fmri}.
The simulations allow for flexibility and the testing of edge cases.
Moving to real data constitutes a step toward a practical, realistic application of \gls{tvfc} estimation.
Since we lack a ground truth (i.e.~target variable) in these latter benchmarks, we will look at how to choose or design \emph{proxies} for it.
The same \gls{tvfc} estimation methods are investigated for all benchmarks in this chapter.
Adding methods to the benchmarking framework should be reasonably easy, and all required code will be made available upon publishing.
