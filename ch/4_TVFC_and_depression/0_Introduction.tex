\info[inline]{Paragraph: Transition from methods development and benchmarking to application.}
In the prior two chapters we discussed and convinced ourselves of how to robustly estimate \gls{tvfc} through the proposed benchmarking framework.
Now we are ready to take the most robust method and apply it on a real world data set to answer a scientific question.
%
In this chapter we investigate whether \gls{tvfc} estimates have predictive power in a clinical setting.
Specifically, in this study we are interested in how \gls{tvfc} estimates differ between depressed (professionally diagnosed as \gls{mdd} or self-reported) and \gls{hc} individuals.
Such contrasts may shed new light on how this condition affects brain dynamics, and which brain regions are involved (see also \cref{sec:fc-depression}).
In turn, this may inform treatment targets.
