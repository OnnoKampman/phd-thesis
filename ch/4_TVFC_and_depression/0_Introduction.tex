\info[inline]{Paragraph: Transition from methods development and benchmarking to application.}
In the prior two chapters we discussed and convinced ourselves of how to robustly estimate \gls{tvfc} through a proposed benchmarking framework.
Now we are ready to take the most robust and best method and apply it on a real-world data set to answer a scientific question.
%
This chapter investigates whether \gls{tvfc} estimates have predictive power in a clinical setting.
Specifically, in this study we are interested in how \gls{tvfc} estimates differ between depressed (both professionally diagnosed as \gls{mdd} and self-reported) and \gls{hc} individuals.
Such contrasts may shed new light on how this condition affects brain dynamics, and which brain regions are involved (see also \cref{sec:fc-depression} for background and motivation).
In turn, this may inform treatment targets.
